The home is in a quiet, peaceful neighborhood in Frisco, so it is easy access to our jobs and daily commute.  Ms. Glenda is so sweet and giving to our daughter.

He was 3 months old when we first brought him to daycare.  From the first day we dropped him off, we felt so safe and comfortable.  She does an amazing job taking care of our child.",

Second, she offers a well-rounded program from Spanish to full meal service included within the tuition.  And last, Ms. Glenda is actively engaged in her school...she is there every day to greet us at the front door and walks the children out in the evening.  She cares a lot about the welfare of the children. ",
